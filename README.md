# Employee Burnout Prediction for IBM

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee burnout using the 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance' dataset available on Kaggle. Through the analysis of various HR-related metrics, the project seeks to understand the key factors contributing to employee turnover and provide insights into potential retention strategies.

## Data Collection
- **Dataset:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Scope:** The dataset includes data collected from 1470 employees, encompassing 35 different features related to demographic details, job characteristics, performance metrics, and attrition status.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Repository Structure
- **employee-burnout-prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis.
- **data/:** Directory containing the original dataset used in the analysis.
- **figures/:** Directory containing visualizations generated during the analysis.

## How to Run
- Ensure you have Jupyter installed and the required Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Navigate to the notebook employee-burnout-prediction.ipynb.
- Run the Jupyter notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Analysis Results
The project uncovers several key indicators of employee burnout, with insights into aspects such as job satisfaction, monthly income, years at the company, and work-life balance. Predictive modeling helps identify employees at high risk of turnover, allowing for proactive retention strategies.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the importance of strategic HR analytics in mitigating employee turnover. By understanding the underlying factors of burnout, organizations can implement targeted interventions to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.
